<p>
This page contains links to PDF versions of additional documentation for the
book <i>Compiling with C# and Java</i> by P.D. Terry (Pearson Education, 2005)

<p>
*** This version of the Resource Kit is designed for case studies that would
    match the "instantiable" release of Coco/R.  In that release, the generated
    classes do not export static methods only, as is the case for nearly all
    the case studies discussed in the text book.  In many cases the
    differences are fairly minor, and the code has been written to minimize
    the differences.
